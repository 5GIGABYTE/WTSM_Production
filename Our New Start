Hello Fellow 5GIGABYTE Followers!

Me and WTSM Production are making something AMAZING and LIFE CHANGING.


Here is our picture 

We are trying to acheive a program called DataUnlock for PCS, Laptops, Phones, Tablets, Foldable Phones.

Here is what DataUnlock can do: 

1. It can turn on your computers internal data, which means this program gives you 100GB of 3G data (depending how old it is) Newer computers will recieve 4G LTE or 5G depending where you are.

2. Our service is powered by T-Mobile. This program will apply you 30 days of 100GB data and when the service date ends, just create a new account or download a new release.

3. This service is only supported in United States, India, Canada, and United Kingdom. Later on we will add support for worldwide connection.

4. T-Mobile & @5GIGABYTE have made an agreement to the policy of running their 30 day free trial service on Smartphones, Tablets, and Computers.

5. It runs off a eSIM, so you don't have to buy a physical SIM card to use this service! :)

Thanks for reading. All agreements are on this Google Document - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEM2kqdbZBHQZHwTmiC9r32D5yE9U2WQiOVJZXxCKCk/edit?usp=sharing
